## discussion

story game, **like pokemon**, sub-plots (cases for other clients), sub-plots can contribute to the main story but don't have to
relationship system, stealth segments

### setting

old london
time span of a few weeks/months past and future
some clues are years back

### time travelling

time travel stations - each has a fixed travel point
time travel coins - insert into stations (like in phone booths)
stations can only go back in time
stations can't go further than the time they were built (near the present)

1. insert coin
2. cutscene - player dials number
3. travel

would kill people as a last resot

### story - the big plot

an ordinary case turns huge
mafia
